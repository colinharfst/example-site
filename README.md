This project was developed with a simple create-react-app followed by initializing an express server and connecting to a mongodb cluster.

## To Develop

To run this project locally, you should do the following:

### `cd client && npm i`

This installs the dependencies for our client-side processes.

### `cd .. && npm i`

This installs the dependencies for our server-side processes.

### `npm run dev`

This concurrently builds the front-end and back-end for our application<br />
The front-end is available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).<br/>
The back-end is proxied through [http://localhost:5000/api/](http://localhost:5000/api/hello).

### Deployment

This app will be deployed through [heroku](www.heroku.com).
